Hi, my name is Belma Nurkic.
I'm studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tuzla. 
During my years of study, I gained a lot of experience in object-oriented programming and programming languages such as: C, C++, C#, and Python. 
I am completely dedicated to work, interested in many branches of electrical engineering and am looking forward to every new experience.
Some of my projects from college are available on my profile, of which there will of course be more and more over time. 
The fields that interest me the most and to which I am dedicated are Automation and Robotics.
Also I am trying to improve my work skills with Web pages, especially because I have some experience working in html and css.
